# YT-CSS
My Custom CSS overrides for theming Youtube.

Use with Youtube Enhancer Extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enhancer-for-youtube/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search.

It is recommended to import the enhancer config provided from **youtube-enhancer.txt**, copy raw, and and paste in the pop up that appears when clicking import at the bottom of the extensions settings page.

Then copy raw from **YT.css** and paste it under 'custom theme' in the extension settings page.

Finally tweek the general and specific settings inside 'root' to get the style you desire
